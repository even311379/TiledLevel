 Tiled level plugin is a level design tool that allows you to paint modular assets directly. Setup tiled item set from your static mesh or actor, and you are ready to paint these 3D assets like a 2D tile map. Makes level design from modular assets way easier and intuitive and prototypes your design idea way faster.

 Watch the short trailer video for what it is for.
